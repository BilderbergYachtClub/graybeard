# Graybeard

Opinionated static site template for boomers.

## Getting started

Graybeard assumes that you'll deploy to [Zeit](https://zeit.co/), so you may want to register for an account if you haven't already.

Oh and you'll also need [Zeit CLI](https://zeit.co/download). You can install this by running

```bash
$ yarn global add now
```

Now that the prerequisites are out of the way, you can get started by running

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:BilderbergYachtClub/graybeard.git {project_directory}
$ cd {project_directory}
$ yarn install
```

You'll need to link the project to Zeit by running `now`. Once linked you can start Graybeard with `yarn go`.
